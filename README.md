## ⚠️ Important Information

### Administrator Rights Required

Many features require administrator privileges:
- ✅ Cleaning system directories
- ✅ Service management (gaming/extreme modes)
- ✅ Power plan changes
- ✅ Network optimization
- ✅ CPU priority registry modifications
- ✅ RAM trimming operations

**Always run SysCleaner as Administrator**

### Safety First

**Before first use:**
1. Create a System Restore Point
2. Close all important programs
3. Test cleaning categories individually first

**SysCleaner is safe:**
- ✅ Only deletes temp/cache files
- ✅ Never touches personal documents
- ✅ Open source - verify the code yourself
- ✅ No telemetry or tracking
- ✅ Community-tested

### Antivirus False Positives

System optimization tools often trigger antivirus warnings because they:
- Modify registry (for priority settings, optimizations)
- Stop/start Windows services (gaming modes)
- Access multiple system directories (cleaning)
- Use Windows native APIs (RAM trimming, service control)

**This is normal for legitimate system tools.** SysCleaner is 100% safe and open source.

If needed, add an exception in your antivirus for `SysCleaner.exe`.

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### GUI Won't Launch

```powershell
# Make sure you built with -tags gui:
go build -tags gui -ldflags="-s -w -H=windowsgui" -o SysCleaner.exe

# Check for errors in debug mode:
go build -tags gui -o SysCleaner-debug.exe
.\SysCleaner-debug.exe
# Console window shows any errors
```

### Gaming Mode Not Working

1. Make sure running as Administrator
2. Check Dashboard for mode status
3. Try manually (in Extreme Mode tab)
4. Check Monitor tab for error logs

### RAM Trimming Not Working

1. Only active during Extreme Mode
2. Requires Administrator rights
3. Check Monitor tab for RAM stats
4. Use "Trim RAM Now" button to test manually

### Clean Operation Hangs

v2.0 includes timeout protection, but if issues occur:
1. Close all browsers before cleaning browser caches
2. Restart and try again
3. Clean categories individually
4. Check Monitor tab for errors

### Build Errors

See [docs/BUILDGUIDE.md](docs/BUILDGUIDE.md) for comprehensive troubleshooting:
